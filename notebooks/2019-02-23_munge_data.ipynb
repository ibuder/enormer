Our system uses a single BiLSTM encoder with a shared BPE vocabulary for all languages, which is coupled with an auxiliary decoder and trained on publicly available parallel corpora. This enables us to learn a classifier on top of the resulting sentence embeddings using English annotated data only, and transfer it to any of the 93 languages without any modification...\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n** Jobs\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n* Senior Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer - PepsiCo eCommerce - NYC (https://datascienceweekly.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=71a2b2a38789d4d25b738462f&id=1e21eb26c8&e=c0bb1c42db)\\nWant to build an RL system with real money against business experts?
